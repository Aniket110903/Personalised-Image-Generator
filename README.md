# LoRA Fine-Tuning with Flux Image Generation Model

## Overview
This project fine-tunes the Flux image generation model using **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**. The model is trained on a custom dataset to generate specific outputs, such as personalized face images triggered by specific words.

The project includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- LoRA-based model adaptation
- Training and validation pipelines
- Deployment via a Streamlit web app
